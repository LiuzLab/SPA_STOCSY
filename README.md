# SPA_STOCSY

SPA_STOCSY is a R pipeline for the automatic identification of both "known" and "unknown" metabolites in given samples.  
With given input samples, SPA_STOCSY offers automatic algorithms to estimate all the parameters to generatet the final results.  
Here is an example of using SPA_STOCSY to analyze on 10 NMR samples from brain homogenates of Drosophila melanogaster.  [Click here](https://wanliw96.github.io/SPA_STOCSY/spa_stocsy_menu.html)
